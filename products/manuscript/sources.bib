  abstract = {Introduction:~           The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of 1:40, which has been recognized as an immunologic correlate corresponding to a 50\% reduction in the risk of contracting influenza, is based on studies in adults. Neither seasonal nor challenge-based correlates have been evaluated in children.           Methods:~           A total of 4707 influenza vaccine–naive healthy children 6 to 72 months old were randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 to receive 2 doses of MF-59–adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Novartis Vaccines), trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine subunit (trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine control, GSK), or a saline placebo during the 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 influenza seasons. The second dose was given 30 days after dose 1. Clinical influenza-like illnesses cases identified by active surveillance were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza. Vaccine immunogenicity 50 days after dose 1 was evaluated in a subset of 777 children.           Results:~           Immunogenicity and efficacy results for H3N2 were evaluated against the Prentice criteria, which confirmed that the immunogenicity results warranted estimation of an immunologic correlate. We then used the Dunning model fitting the H3N2 antibody titers at day 50 and the influenza cases observed in the immunogenicity subset to estimate a correlate of protection. This analysis revealed that a cutoff HI titer of 1:110 was associated with the conventional 50\% clinical protection rate against infection during the entire season, and titers of 1:215, 1:330, and 1:629 predicated protection rates of 70\%, 80\%, and 90\%, respectively. The conventional adult HI titer of 1:40 was only associated with 22\% protection.           Conclusions:~           The use of the 1:40 HI adult correlate of protection is not appropriate when evaluating influenza vaccines in children. Although a cutoff of 1:110 may be used to predict the conventional 50\% clinical protection rate, a titer of 1:330 would predict an 80\% protective level, which would seem to be more desirable from a public health perspective.},

  abstract = {Immunocompromised individuals are at high risk of severe illness and complications from influenza infection. For this reason, immunization using inactivated influenza vaccines is recommended for transplant patients, individuals receiving immunosuppressant treatments, and other persons with immunodeficiency. However, these immunocompromised populations are more likely to have lower and nonprotective responses to annual vaccination with a standard influenza vaccine. Here, we review strategies aimed to improve the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in immunocompromised populations. The different strategies employed have included adjuvanted vaccines, high-dose vaccines, booster doses, intradermal vaccination, and temporary discontinuation of immunosuppressant treatment regimens. High-dose trivalent, inactivated, split-virus influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) is so far one of the leading strategies for improving vaccine responses in HIV patients, transplant patients, and persons receiving immunosuppressant therapies for inflammatory diseases. Several studies in these populations have shown stronger humoral responses with IIV3-HD than existing standard-dose trivalent vaccine, and comparable safety. Accordingly, some scientific societies have stated that high-dose influenza vaccine could be a preferred option for immunocompromised patients. However, larger randomized controlled studies are needed to validate relative immunogenicity and safety of IIV3-HD and other enhanced vaccines and vaccination strategies in immunocompromised individuals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-dose (HD) influenza vaccine offers improved protection from influenza virus infection among older adults compared with standard-dose (SD) vaccine. Here, we explored whether HD vaccine attenuates disease severity among older adults with breakthrough influenza. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of US claims data for influenza seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019, defined as 1 October through 30 April, among adults aged ≥65 years. After adjusting the different cohorts for the probability of vaccination conditional on patients' characteristics, we compared 30-day mortality rate post-influenza among older adults who experienced breakthrough infection after receipt of HD or SD influenza vaccines and among those not vaccinated (NV). RESULTS: We evaluated 44 456 influenza cases: 23 109 (52\%) were unvaccinated, 15 037 (33.8\%) received HD vaccine, and 6310 (14.2\%) received SD vaccine. Significant reductions in mortality rates among breakthrough cases were observed across all 3 seasons for HD vs NV, ranging from 17\% to 29\% reductions. A significant mortality reduction of 25\% was associated with SD vaccination vs NV in the 2016-2017 season when there was a good match between circulating influenza viruses and selected vaccine strains. When comparing HD vs SD cohorts, mortality reductions were higher among those who received HD in the last 2 seasons when mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating H3N2 viruses was documented, albeit not significant. CONCLUSIONS: HD vaccination was associated with lower post-influenza mortality among older adults with breakthrough influenza, even during seasons when antigenically drifted H3N2 circulated. Improved understanding of the impact of different vaccines on attenuating disease severity is warranted when assessing vaccine policy recommendations.},

We present here the second step of a two-step approach allowing performing such predictions and use it to compare a new trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine administered by the intradermal (ID) route (INTANZA®/IDFlU®) with the vaccine administered by the classical intramuscular (IM) route.ResultsPooling all available immunogenicity data, the predicted vaccine efficacy was 63.3\% [CI: 58.1; 68.7] for ID route and 54.4\% [CI: 49.4; 59.2] for IM route. The corresponding relative increase in efficacy was 16.5\% [CI: 12.7; 20.1]. Predicted vaccine efficacies decreased with age for both vaccines, but the decrease was less marked by ID route: the relative increase in efficacy for subjects aged 70 years and above is of 18.0\% [CI:12;24]:MethodsThe first step corresponding to the estimation of the level of protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza that can be linked to each HI titer, referred to as the HI protection curve, was achieved by using a meta-analytical approach based on published information. Vaccine efficacy and differences in vaccine efficacy are predicted in a second step using this HI protection curve alongside the results of two randomized clinical trials providing comparative information on the immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines administered ID or IM in 3,503 \& 1,645 elderly participants, respectively.ConclusionThe analysis performed confirmed that the superior immune response provided by the vaccine using the ID route should translate into a higher vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza.},

An HI titre of 1:40 is generally accepted to correspond to a 50\% reduction in the risk of contracting influenza in a susceptible population, but limited attempts have been made to further quantify the association between HI titre and protective efficacy.We present a model, using a meta-analytical approach, that estimates the level of clinical protection against influenza at any HI titre level. Source data were derived from a systematic literature review that identified 15 studies, representing a total of 5899 adult subjects and 1304 influenza cases with interval-censored information on HI titre. The parameters of the relationship between HI titre and clinical protection were estimated using Bayesian inference with a consideration of random effects and censorship in the available information.A significant and positive relationship between HI titre and clinical protection against influenza was observed in all tested models. This relationship was found to be similar irrespective of the type of viral strain (A or B) and the vaccination status of the individuals.Although limitations in the data used should not be overlooked, the relationship derived in this analysis provides a means to predict the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines when only immunogenicity data are available. This relationship can also be useful for comparing the efficacy of different influenza vaccines based on their immunological profile.},

We fitted Cox proportional hazards models to the time to laboratory-confirmed influenza B. We used causal mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of the total effect of vaccination that was mediated by higher HAI titers.We estimated that vaccine efficacy against confirmed B/Victoria infection was 68\% (95\% confidence interval, 33\%, 88\%), and post-vaccination HAI titers explained 57\% of the effect of vaccination on protection.The majority of the effect of inactivated influenza vaccination in children is mediated by the increased HAI titer after vaccination; however, other components of the immune response to vaccination may also play a role in protection and should be further explored.

This study evaluated whether IIV3-HD also improves protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. METHODS: We conducted a phase IIIb-IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial to compare IIV3-HD (60 μg of hemagglutinin per strain) with standard-dose trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-SD [15 μg of hemagglutinin per strain]) in adults 65 years of age or older. Assessments of relative efficacy, effectiveness, safety (serious adverse events), and immunogenicity (hemagglutination-inhibition [HAI] titers) were performed during the 2011-2012 (year 1) and the 2012-2013 (year 2) northern-hemisphere influenza seasons. RESULTS: A total of 31,989 participants were enrolled from 126 research centers in the United States and Canada (15,991 were randomly assigned to receive IIV3-HD, and 15,998 to receive IIV3-SD). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 228 participants in the IIV3-HD group (1.4\%) and 301 participants in the IIV3-SD group (1.9\%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza caused by any viral type or subtype associated with a protocol-defined influenza-like illness (relative efficacy, 24.2\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 9.7 to 36.5). At least one serious adverse event during the safety surveillance period was reported by 1323 (8.3\%) of the participants in the IIV3-HD group, as compared with 1442 (9.0\%) of the participants in the IIV3-SD group (relative risk, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.85 to 0.99). After vaccination, HAI titers and seroprotection rates (the percentage of participants with HAI titers ≥ 1:40) were significantly higher in the IIV3-HD group. Conclusions: Among persons 65 years of age or older, IIV3-HD induced significantly higher antibody responses and provided better protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness than did IIV3-SD.

A new quantitative framework proposed here (“PoDBAY,” Probability of Disease Bayesian Analysis), estimates vaccine efficacy (and confidence interval) using immune response biomarker data collected shortly after vaccination. Given a biomarker associated with protection, PoDBAY describes the relationship between biomarker and probability of disease as a sigmoid probability of disease (“PoD”) curve. The PoDBAY framework is illustrated using clinical trial simulations and with data for influenza, zoster, and dengue virus vaccines. The simulations demonstrate that PoDBAY efficacy estimation (which integrates the PoD and biomarker data), can be accurate and more precise than the standard (case-count) estimation, contributing to more sensitive and specific decisions than threshold-based correlate of protection or case-count-based methods. For all three vaccine examples, the PoD fit indicates a substantial association between the biomarkers and protection, and efficacy estimated by PoDBAY from relatively little immunogenicity data is predictive of the standard estimate of efficacy, demonstrating how PoDBAY can provide early assessments of vaccine efficacy. Methods like PoDBAY can help accelerate and economize vaccine development using an immunological predictor of protection. For example, in the current effort against the COVID-19 pandemic it might provide information to help prioritize (rank) candidates both earlier in a trial and earlier in development.},

  abstract = {Immunological assays measure characteristics of the immune system, such as antibody levels, specific to certain diseases. High assay values are often associated with protection from disease. A question of interest is how the relationship between assay values and subsequent development of disease should be quantitatively modelled. Existing approaches successfully model the relationship for high assay values, where the probability of developing disease is low. However at low assay values, the probability of developing disease is more closely associated with factors such as disease prevalence rates and an individual's chance of exposure to infection; these are less well captured by existing models. This paper presents a model that accommodates both assay values and factors independent of assay values, enabling protection from disease to be modelled over the whole range of assay values and proposing a method for predicting the efficacy of a vaccine from the assays of vaccinees and non-vaccinees.},

A recent vaccine efficacy trial comparing standard-dose with high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine in persons 65 years of age and older provided the opportunity to examine the relationship between values of three immunologic assays and protection against community-acquired A/H3N2 influenza illness. The high-dose vaccine induced significantly higher antibody titers than the standard-dose vaccine for all assays. For the hemagglutination inhibition assay, a titer of 40 was found to correspond with 50\% protection when the assay virus was antigenically well matched to the circulating virus—the same titer as is generally recognized for 50\% protection in younger adults. A dramatically higher titer was required for 50\% protection when the assay virus was a poor match to the circulating virus. With the well-matched virus, some protection was seen at the lowest titers; with the poorly matched virus, high levels of protection were not achieved even at the highest titers. Strong associations were also seen between virus neutralization test titers and protection, but reliable estimates for 50\% protection were not obtained. An association was seen between titers of an enzyme-linked lectin assay for antineuraminidase N2 antibodies and protection; in particular, the proportion of treatment effect explained by assay titer in models that included both this assay and one of the other assays was consistently higher than in models that included either assay alone.

However, direct serological evidence linked to susceptibility is limited. Here we analysed haemagglutination-inhibition titres in 1,451 cross-sectional samples collected between 1992 and 2020, from individuals born between 1917 and 2008, against influenza B virus (IBV) isolates from 1940 to 2021. We included testing of ‘future’ isolates that circulated after sample collection. We show that immunological biases are conferred by early life IBV infection and result in lineage-specific cross-reactivity of a birth cohort towards future IBV isolates. This translates into differential estimates of susceptibility between birth cohorts towards the B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages, predicting lineage-specific birth-cohort distributions of observed medically attended IBV infections. Our data suggest that immunological measurements of imprinting could be important in modelling and predicting virus epidemiology.},

  abstract = {Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has been a public health concern for almost 20years due to its potential ability to become transmissible among humans. Phase I and II clinical trials have assessed safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccines. A shortage of vaccine is likely to occur during the first months of a pandemic. Hence, determining whether to give one dose to more people or two doses to fewer people to best protect the population is essential. We use hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers as an immune correlate for avian influenza vaccines. Using an established relationship to obtain a theoretical vaccine efficacy from immunogenicity data from thirteen arms of six phase I and phase II clinical trials of inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccines, we assessed: (1) the proportion of theoretical vaccine efficacy achieved after a single dose (defined as primary response level), and (2) whether theoretical efficacy increases after a second dose, with and without adjuvant. Participants receiving vaccine with AS03 adjuvant had higher primary response levels (range: 0.48-0.57) compared to participants receiving vaccine with MF59 adjuvant (range: 0.32-0.47), with no observed trends in primary response levels by antigen dosage. After the first and second doses, vaccine with AS03 at dosage levels 3.75, 7.5 and 15mcg had the highest estimated theoretical vaccine efficacy: Dose (1) 45\% (95\% CI: 36-57\%), 53\% (95\% CI: 42-63\%) and 55\% (95\% CI: 44-64\%), respectively and Dose (2) 93\% (95\% CI: 89-96\%), 97\% (95\% CI: 95-98\%) and 97\% (95\% CI: 96-100\%), respectively. On average, the estimated theoretical vaccine efficacy of lower dose adjuvanted vaccines (AS03 and MF59) was 17\% higher than that of higher dose unadjuvanted vaccines, suggesting that including an adjuvant is dose-sparing. These data indicate adjuvanted inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine produces high theoretical efficacy after two doses to protect individuals against a potential avian influenza pandemic.},

  abstract = {Seasonal influenza is a primary public health burden in the USA and globally. Annual vaccination programs are designed on the basis of circulating influenza viral strains. However, the effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine is highly variable between seasons and among individuals. A number of factors are known to influence vaccination effectiveness including age, sex, and comorbidities. Here, we sought to determine whether whole blood gene expression profiling prior to vaccination is informative about pre-existing immunological status and the immunological response to vaccine. We performed whole transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of whole blood samples obtained prior to vaccination from 275 participants enrolled in an annual influenza vaccine trial. Serological status prior to vaccination and 28 days following vaccination was assessed using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) to define baseline immune status and the response to vaccination. We find evidence that genes with immunological functions are increased in expression in individuals with higher pre-existing immunity and in those individuals who mount a greater response to vaccination. Using a random forest model, we find that this set of genes can be used to predict vaccine response with a performance similar to a model that incorporates physiological and prior vaccination status alone. A model using both gene expression and physiological factors has the greatest predictive power demonstrating the potential utility of molecular profiling for enhancing prediction of vaccine response. Moreover, expression of genes that are associated with enhanced vaccination response may point to additional biological pathways that contribute to mounting a robust immunological response to the seasonal influenza vaccine.},

Using this problem of evaluating an immunological surrogate as an illustration, we describe a hierarchy of three criteria for a valid surrogate endpoint and statistical analysis frameworks for evaluating them. Based on a placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy trial, the first level entails assessing the correlation of an immune response with a study endpoint in the study groups, and the second level entails evaluating an immune response as a surrogate for the study endpoint that can be used for predicting vaccine efficacy for a setting similar to that of the vaccine trial. We show that baseline covariates, innovative study design, and a potential outcomes formulation can be helpful for this assessment. The third level entails validation of a surrogate endpoint via meta-analysis, where the goal is to evaluate how well the immune response can be used to predict vaccine efficacy for new settings (building bridges). A simulated vaccine trial and two example vaccine trials are presented, one supporting that certain anti-influenza antibody levels are an excellent surrogate for influenza illness and another supporting that certain anti-HIV antibody levels are not useful as a surrogate for HIV infection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 50 000 influenza-associated deaths occur annually in the United States, overwhelmingly among individuals aged ≥65 years. Although vaccination is the primary prevention tool, investigations have shown low vaccine effectiveness (VE) in recent years, particularly among the elderly. We analyzed the relative VE (RVE) of all influenza vaccines among Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years to prevent influenza hospital encounters during the 2019-2020 season. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using Poisson regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Exposures included egg-based high-dose trivalent (HD-IIV3), egg-based adjuvanted trivalent (aIIV3), egg-based standard dose (SD) quadrivalent (IIV4), cell-based SD quadrivalent (cIIV4), and recombinant quadrivalent (RIV4) influenza vaccines. RESULTS: We studied 12.7 million vaccinated beneficiaries. Following IPTW, cohorts were well balanced for all covariates and health-seeking behavior indicators. In the adjusted analysis, RIV4 (RVE, 13.3\%; 95\% CI, 7.4-18.9\%), aIIV3 (RVE, 8.2\%; 95\% CI, 4.2-12.0\%), and HD-IIV3 (RVE, 6.8\%; 95\% CI, 3.3-10.1\%) were significantly more effective in preventing hospital encounters than the reference egg-based SD IIV4, while cIIV4 was not significantly more effective than IIV4 (RVE, 2.8\%; 95\% CI, -2.8\%, 8.2\%). Our results were consistent across all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this influenza B-Victoria and A(H1N1)-dominated season, RIV4 was moderately more effective than other vaccines, while HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 were more effective than the IIV4 vaccines, highlighting the contributions of antigen amount and adjuvant use to VE. Egg adaptation likely did not substantially affect our RVE evaluation. Our findings, specific to the 2019-2020 season, should be evaluated in other studies using virological case confirmation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccine efficacy/effectiveness can vary from season to season due in part to the dominant circulating strains and antigenic matching. This study reviews the relative vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (rVE) of high-dose inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines (SD-IIV) in adults aged~≥~65~years against influenza-associated outcomes. Additional sub-analyses of HD-IIV3 rVE were performed by the predominantly circulating influenza strain and the antigenic match or mismatch of the vaccine against the predominant circulating strains. METHODS: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted for studies assessing the rVE of HD-IIV3 against probable/laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI), hospital admissions, and death in adults aged~≥~65~years. Results from individual seasons were extracted from the studies, and viral surveillance data were used to determine the dominant circulating strains and antigenic match for each season. Results were then stratified based on clinical outcomes and seasonal characteristics and meta-analyzed to estimate pooled rVEs of HD-IIV3. RESULTS: 15 publications were meta-analyzed after screening 1,293 studies, providing data on 10 consecutive influenza seasons and over 22 million individuals receiving HD-IIV3 in randomized and observational settings. Across all influenza seasons, HD-IIV3 demonstrated improved protection against ILI compared to SD-IIV (rVE~=~15.9\%, 95\% CI: 4.1-26.3\%). HD-IIV3 was also more effective at preventing hospital admissions from all-causes (rVE~=~8.4\%, 95\% CI: 5.7-11.0\%), as well as influenza (rVE~=~11.7\%, 95\% CI: 7.0-16.1\%), pneumonia (rVE~=~27.3\%, 95\% CI: 15.3-37.6\%), combined pneumonia/influenza (rVE~=~13.4\%, 95\% CI: 7.3-19.2\%) and cardiorespiratory events (rVE~=~17.9\%, 95\% CI: 15.0-20.8\%). Reductions in mortality due to pneumonia/influenza (rVE~=~39.9\%, 95\% CI: 18.6-55.6\%) and cardiorespiratory causes (rVE~=~27.7\%, 95\% CI: 13.2-32.0\%) were also observed. Similar pooled rVEs were observed in both matched and mismatched seasons and in seasons where A/H3N2 or A/H1N1 strains were predominantly circulating. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence over 10 consecutive influenza seasons and in more than 34 million individuals aged~≥~65~years suggests that HD-IIV3 is consistently more effective than SD-IIV at reducing influenza cases as well as influenza-associated clinical complications irrespective of circulating strain and antigenic match.

  abstract = {There is increasing attention to the need to identify new immune markers for the evaluation of existing and new influenza vaccines. Immune markers that could predict individual protection against infection and disease, commonly called correlates of protection (CoPs), play an important role in vaccine development and licensing. Here, we discuss the epidemiologic considerations when evaluating immune markers as potential CoPs for influenza vaccines and emphasize the distinction between correlation and causation. While an immune marker that correlates well with protection from infection can be used as a predictor of vaccine efficacy, it should be distinguished from an immune marker that plays a mechanistic role in conferring protection against a clinical endpoint—the latter might be a more reliable predictor of vaccine efficacy and a more appropriate target for rational vaccine design. To clearly distinguish mechanistic and nonmechanistic CoPs, we suggest using the term “correlates of protection” for nonmechanistic CoPs, and ‘‘mediators of protection’’ for mechanistic CoPs. Furthermore, because the interactions among and relative importance of correlates or mediators of protection can vary according to age or prior vaccine experience, the effect sizes and thresholds for protective effects for CoPs could also vary in different segments of the population.},

This review aims to identify how rVE evaluation is being performed in studies of influenza to inform a more standardized approach. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for studies reporting rVE comparing vaccine components, dose, or vaccination schedules. We screened titles, abstracts, full texts, and references to identify relevant articles. We extracted information on the study design, relative comparison made, and the definition and statistical approach used to estimate rVE in each study. RESULTS: We identified 63 articles assessing rVE in influenza virus. Studies compared multiple vaccine components (n = 38), two or more doses of the same vaccine (n = 17), or vaccination timing or history (n = 9). One study compared a range of vaccine components and doses. Nearly two-thirds of all studies controlled for age, and nearly half for comorbidities, region, and sex. Assessment of 12 studies presenting both absolute and relative effect estimates suggested proportionality in the effects, resulting in implications for the interpretation of rVE effects. CONCLUSIONS: Approaches to rVE evaluation in practice is highly varied, with improvements in reporting required in many cases. Extensive consideration of methodologic issues relating to rVE is needed, including the stability of estimates and the impact of confounding structure on the validity of rVE estimates.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that innate and adaptive cellular responses mediate resistance to the influenza virus and confer protection after vaccination. However, few studies have resolved the contribution of cellular responses within the context of preexisting antibody titers. Here, we measured the peripheral immune profiles of 206 vaccinated or unvaccinated adults to determine how baseline variations in the cellular and humoral immune compartments contribute independently or synergistically to the risk of developing symptomatic influenza. Protection correlated with diverse and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T, circulating T follicular helper, T helper type 17, myeloid dendritic and CD16+ natural killer (NK) cell subsets. Conversely, increased susceptibility was predominantly attributed to nonspecific inflammatory populations, including γδ T cells and activated CD16− NK cells, as well as TNFα+ single-cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells. Multivariate and predictive modeling indicated that cellular subsets (1) work synergistically with humoral immunity to confer protection, (2) improve model performance over demographic and serologic factors alone and (3) comprise the most important predictive covariates. Together, these results demonstrate that preinfection peripheral cell composition improves the prediction of symptomatic influenza susceptibility over vaccination, demographics or serology alone.},

Questions have been raised about its use as a surrogate for vaccine efficacy, particularly with regard to an absolute titer indicating seroprotection. METHODS: We examined hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titers in subjects from a placebo-controlled trial of inactivated and live attenuated vaccines and compared titers in subjects with symptomatic influenza (cases) to those without influenza infection (noncases). RESULTS: Prevaccination and postvaccination geometric mean titers were both significantly lower for cases compared with noncases in all intervention groups. Frequency of postvaccination seroconversion did not significantly differ for cases and noncases in either vaccine group. Among live attenuated vaccine and placebo recipients, cases were less likely than noncases to have postvaccination HAI titers ≥32 or 64. Nearly all recipients of inactivated vaccine had postvaccination titers of at least 64, and the small number of vaccine failures were scattered across titers ranging from 64 to 2048. CONCLUSIONS: While HAI antibody is the major correlate of protection, postvaccination titers alone should not be used as a surrogate for vaccine efficacy. Vaccine failures from clinical trials need to be examined to determine why seemingly protective HAI titers may not protect. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT00538512.},

  abstract = {Background: High-dose (HD) influenza vaccine, currently the most commonly used vaccine among US seniors (aged ! 65 years), has been shown to be more efficacious than standard-dose (SD) vaccine in multiple randomized trials. This study evaluated the real-world relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of HD vs SD over four influenza seasons. Methods: This study included Medicare Fee-for-Service enrollees who received HD or SD at an outpatient clinic or pharmacy during influenza seasons 2011–2012 through 2014–2015. Probable influenza (an inpatient stay with an influenza diagnosis on the claim, or an outpatient visit with a rapid influenza test/culture followed by an antiviral prescription) was assessed among HD recipients matched 1:1 with SD recipients by location, vaccination date, age, and sex. Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models with competing risk of death were used to adjust for residual confounding. Analyses were stratified by outpatient vs pharmacy vaccination. Results: Across the four influenza seasons, there were 535,598, 1,017,552, 1,548,164, and 2,420,450 in the pharmacy cohort; and 821,662, 1,151,080, 1,559,488, and 2,421,758 in the outpatient cohort. During peak influenza season, rVEs for 2011–12 through 2014–15 were 21.8\% (95\% CI: À5.9\%, 42.3\%), 14.8\% (9.3\%, 19.9\%), 16.9\% (9.2\%, 23.9\%), and 17.2\% (14.5\%, 19.9\%), respectively, in the pharmacy cohort; and 16.5\% (À5.9\%, 34.2\%), 15.1\% (10.9\%, 19.1\%), 10.0\% (2.9\%, 16.6\%), and À0.2\% (À3.0\%, 2.5\%), respectively, in the outpatient cohort. Conclusion: HD was consistently associated with better protection against probable influenza. The lower treatment effect observed in the outpatient cohort could reflect provider bias due to physicians triaging HD to frailer patients.},

  abstract = {A marker of immune function that statistically correlates with protection after vaccination may be either a mechanistic correlate of protection or a nonmechanistic correlate of protection, which does not cause protection, but predicts protection., Identification of immune correlates of protection after vaccination is an important part of vaccinology for both theoretical and practical reasons. The terminology and definition of correlates have been confusing, because different authors have used variable terms and concepts. Here, we attempt to give precision to the field by defining 3 terms: correlate of protection (CoP), mechanistic correlate of protection (mCoP), and nonmechanistic correlate of protection (nCoP). A CoP is a marker of immune function that statistically correlates with protection after vaccination that may be either an mCoP, which is a mechanistic cause of protection, or an nCoP, which does not cause protection but nevertheless predicts protection through its (partial) correlation with another immune response(s) that mechanistically protects.},

  abstract = {Influenza vaccines remain the primary public health tool in reducing the ever-present burden of influenza and its complications. In seeking more immunogenic, more effective and more broadly cross-protective influenza vaccines, the landscape of influenza vaccines is rapidly expanding, both in near-term advances and next-generation vaccine design. Although the first influenza vaccines were licensed over 60 years ago, the hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titer is currently the only universally accepted immune correlate of protection against influenza. However, hemagglutination-inhibition titers appear to be less effective at predicting protection in populations at high risk for severe influenza disease; older adults, young children and those with certain medical conditions. The lack of knowledge and validated methods to measure alternate immune markers of protection against influenza remain a substantial barrier to the development of more immunogenic, broadly cross-reactive and effective influenza vaccines. Here, the authors review the knowledge of immune effectors of protection against influenza and discuss assessment methods for a broader range of immunological parameters that could be considered in the evaluation of traditional or new-generation influenza vaccines.},

  abstract = {Background: The availability of high-dose (HD) influenza vaccine for seniors should decrease influenzarelated hospitalization. Studies to date show a range of mostly moderate increased HD vaccine effectiveness (VE). While a ‘healthy vaccinee’ phenomenon can inflate VE, for influenza and particularly an HD vaccine targeted at frailer adults, an ‘at-risk vaccinee’ bias may deflate VE estimates. We assessed senior HD vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related hospitalization by linking immunization registry records to hospitalizations. We also examined whether adding strata typically ignored in case-control matching schemas, such as residence areas, exact age, and provider biases, would increase VE. Methods: For the 2016–17 influenza season in the Portland metropolitan area, the differential VE for the HD vaccine in preventing PCR-confirmed influenza hospitalization was assessed by a nested series of models across matching strata. For an exact match for high-dose and standard-dose seniors, matching elements included exact age, gender, residence type, race-ethnicity, provider bias, and residence area (zipcode). Results: As a first step, a simple aggregate comparison of influenza-related hospitalization risk showed no added HD effectiveness. For the nested models, adding strata increased VE. In the final model, among 23,712 matched pairs of HD to SD vaccinated seniors, the HD vaccine was 30.7\% (95\%CI: 8–48\%) more effective in preventing influenza-related hospitalization. Conclusion: For this study, the high-dose influenza vaccine provided superior protection for seniors against influenza hospitalization. Including matching elements as exact year of age and residence zipcode all added to the calculation of VE. As a warning, non-matched or overly simple matched VE study designs may substantially under-estimate VE.},

Host information was prospectively collected, and serum samples were collected before and after vaccination in each season. The association between host factors and repeated measures of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) composite scores was assessed by generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations., Results: The mean HAI composite scores for the entire sample (t = 4.26, df = 139, p {$<$} 0.001) and the teenager group (t = 6.44, df = 53, p {$<$} 0.001) declined in the second season, while the changes in the adults were not statistically significant (t = −1.14, df = 85, p = 0.26). A mixture pattern of changes in both directions was observed in the adults when stratified by prior vaccination. In addition, the regression analysis suggested an interactive effect of age and BMI on the HAI composite scores in the overall population (beta = 0.005; 95\% CI, 0.0008–0.01) and the adults (beta = 0.005; 95\% CI, 0.0005–0.01)., Conclusions: Our study found distinct vaccine-elicited immune responses between adults and teenagers when both were repeatedly vaccinated in consecutive years.

Previous studies have established that antibody titer measured by the hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) assay is correlated with protection against influenza virus infection, with an HAI titer of 1:40 generally associated with 50\% protection. Methods. We recruited index cases with confirmed influenza virus infection from outpatient clinics, and followed up their household contacts for 7–10 days to identify secondary infections. Serum samples collected from a subset of household contacts were tested by HAI and microneutralization (MN) assays against prevalent influenza viruses. We analyzed the data using an individual hazard-based transmission model that adjusted for age and vaccination history. Results. Compared to a reference group with antibody titers {$<$}1:10, we found that HAI titers of 1:40 against influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) were associated with 31\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 13\%–46\%) and 31\% (CI, 1\%–53\%) protection against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) virus infection, respectively, while an MN titer of 1:40 against A(H3N2) was associated with 49\% (95\% CI, 7\%–81\%) protection against PCR-confirmed A(H3N2) virus infection. Conclusions. An HAI titer of 1:40 was associated with substantially less than 50\% protection against PCRconfirmed influenza virus infection within households, perhaps because of exposures of greater duration or intensity in that confined setting.},

Viral shedding is used as a proxy measure of infectivity in many studies. However, the evidence for this is limited. METHODS: In a detailed study of influenza virus transmission within households in 2008-12, we recruited index cases with confirmed influenza infection from outpatient clinics, and followed up their household contacts for 7-10 days to identify secondary infections. We used individual-based hazard models to characterize the relationship between individual viral shedding and individual infectivity. RESULTS: We analyzed 386 households with 1147 household contacts. Index cases were separated into 3 groups according to their estimated level of viral shedding at symptom onset. We did not find a statistically significant association of virus shedding with transmission. Index cases in medium and higher viral shedding groups were estimated to have 21\% (95\% CI: -29\%, 113\%) and 44\% (CI: -16\%, 167\%) higher infectivity, compared with those in the lower viral shedding group. CONCLUSIONS: Individual viral load measured by RT-PCR in the nose and throat was at most weakly correlated with individual infectivity in households. Other correlates of infectivity should be examined in future studies.},

  abstract = {The search for a test that can predict vaccine efficacy is an important part of any vaccine development program. Although regulators hesitate to acknowledge any test as a true ‘correlate of protection’, there are many precedents for defining ‘surrogate’ assays. Surrogates can be powerful tools for vaccine optimization, licensure, comparisons between products and development of improved products. When such tests achieve ‘reference’ status however, they can inadvertently become barriers to new technologies that do not work the same way as existing vaccines. This is particularly true when these tests are based upon circularly-defined ‘reference’ or, even worse, proprietary reagents. The situation with inactivated influenza vaccines is a good example of this phenomenon. The most frequently used tests to define vaccine-induced immunity are all serologic assays: hemagglutination inhibition (HI), single radial hemolysis (SRH) and microneutralization (MN). The first two, and particularly the HI assay, have achieved reference status and criteria have been established in many jurisdictions for their use in licensing new vaccines and to compare the performance of different vaccines. However, all of these assays are based on biological reagents that are notoriously difficult to standardize and can vary substantially by geography, by chance (i.e. developing reagents in eggs that may not antigenitically match wild-type viruses) and by intention (ie: choosing reagents that yield the most favorable results). This review describes attempts to standardize these assays to improve their performance as surrogates, the dangers of over-reliance on ‘reference’ serologic assays, the ways that manufacturers can exploit the existing regulatory framework to make their products ‘look good’ and the implications of this long-established system for the introduction of novel influenza vaccines.},

The vaccines designed to protect against seasonal influenza illness must be updated periodically in an effort to match the vaccine strain with currently circulating viruses, and the vaccine manufacturing timeline includes multiple, overlapping processes with a very limited amount of flexibility. In the United States (U.S.), over 150 million doses of seasonal trivalent and quadrivalent vaccine are produced annually, a mammoth effort, particularly in the context of a vaccine with components that usually change on a yearly basis. In addition, emergence of an influenza virus containing an HA subtype that has not recently circulated in humans is an ever present possibility. Recently, pandemic influenza vaccines have been licensed, and the pathways for licensure of pandemic vaccines and subsequent strain updating have been defined. Thus, there are formidable challenges for the regulation of currently licensed influenza vaccines, as well as for the regulation of influenza vaccines under development. This review describes the process of licensing influenza vaccines in the U.S., the process and steps involved in the annual updating of seasonal influenza vaccines, and some recent experiences and regulatory challenges faced in development and evaluation of novel influenza vaccines.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Older adults are prioritized for influenza vaccination but also have lowered antibody responses to the vaccine. Higher-doses of influenza antigen may increase immune response and thus be more effective. Our objectives were to compare the efficacy and safety of the high-dose influenza vaccine to the standard-dose influenza vaccine in the elderly (age{$>$}65). METHODS: Data sources: Randomized trials (RCTs) from Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), ClinicalTrials.gov, reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently identified RCTs comparing high-dose influenza vaccine (60μg of hemagglutinin per strain) to standard-dose influenza vaccine (15μg of hemagglutinin per strain) in adults over the age of 65years. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and funding sources. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: We included seven eligible trials; all were categorized as having a low (n=3) or unclear (n=4) risk of bias. Patients receiving the high-dose vaccine had significantly less risk of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza infections (Relative Risk 0.76, 95\%CI 0.65 to 0.90; I2 0\%, 2 trials, 41,141 patients). Post-vaccination geometric mean titres and seroprotection rates were also higher in high-dose vaccine recipients. There were no protocol-defined serious adverse events in the included trials in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly adults, the high-dose influenza vaccine was well-tolerated, more immunogenic, and more efficacious in preventing influenza infections than the standard-dose vaccine. Further pragmatic trials are needed to determine if the higher efficacy translates into higher vaccine effectiveness in adults over the age of 65.},

  abstract = {Seroprevalence survey is the most practical method for accurately estimating infection attack rate (IAR) in an epidemic such as influenza. These studies typically entail selecting an arbitrary titer threshold for seropositivity (e.g. microneutralization [MN] 1:40) and assuming the probability of seropositivity given infection (infection-seropositivity probability, ISP) is 100\% or similar to that among clinical cases. We hypothesize that such conventions are not necessarily robust because different thresholds may result in different IAR estimates and serologic responses of clinical cases may not be representative. To illustrate our hypothesis, we used an age-structured transmission model to fully characterize the transmission dynamics and seroprevalence rises of 2009 influenza pandemic A/H1N1 (pdmH1N1) during its first wave in Hong Kong. We estimated that while 99\% of pdmH1N1 infections became MN1:20 seropositive, only 72\%, 62\%, 58\% and 34\% of infections among age 3-12, 13-19, 20-29, 30-59 became MN1:40 seropositive, which was much lower than the 90\%-100\% observed among clinical cases. The fitted model was consistent with prevailing consensus on pdmH1N1 transmission characteristics (e.g. initial reproductive number of 1.28 and mean generation time of 2.4 days which were within the consensus range), hence our ISP estimates were consistent with the transmission dynamics and temporal buildup of population-level immunity. IAR estimates in influenza seroprevalence studies are sensitive to seropositivity thresholds and ISP adjustments which in current practice are mostly chosen based on conventions instead of systematic criteria. Our results thus highlighted the need for reexamining conventional practice to develop standards for analyzing influenza serologic data (e.g. real-time assessment of bias in ISP adjustments by evaluating the consistency of IAR across multiple thresholds and with mixture models), especially in the context of pandemics when robustness and comparability of IAR estimates are most needed for informing situational awareness and risk assessment. The same principles are broadly applicable for seroprevalence studies of other infectious disease outbreaks.},

  abstract = {The seasonal influenza vaccine is only effective in half of the vaccinated population. To identify determinants of vaccine efficacy, we used data from {$>$}\,1,300 vaccination events to predict the response to vaccination measured as seroconversion as well as hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer levels one year after. We evaluated the predictive capabilities of age, body mass index (BMI), sex, race, comorbidities, vaccination history, and baseline HAI titers, as well as vaccination month and vaccine dose in multiple linear regression models. The models predicted the categorical response for {$>$}\,75\% of the cases in all subsets with one exception. Prior vaccination, baseline titer level, and age were the major determinants of seroconversion, all of which had negative effects. Further, we identified a gender effect in older participants and an effect of vaccination month. BMI had a surprisingly small effect, likely due to its correlation with age. Comorbidities, vaccine dose, and race had negligible effects. Our models can generate a new seroconversion score that is corrected for the impact of these factors which can facilitate future biomarker identification., Computational modeling quantifies the effects of confounding factors on the serological response to flu vaccination in large human cohorts and reveals a differential impact of prior vaccination status, recipient age, and the month of vaccination.},
